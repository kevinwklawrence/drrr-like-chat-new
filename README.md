# WHY SHOULD I USE THIS OVER THE ORIGINAL?
Because the original sucks. The source code is extremely outdated, and it was never maintained to keep up with more current versions of the languages it uses, leading to a lot of errors involving deprecated functions. This version also has a ton of new features 
other drrr-like-chat projects don't have. 

# HOW DO I SET UP THE SQL?
There is a file labed "sql_setup.txt" in the root directory, with SQL code which you just insert directly into your database. It will make everything for you.

# WHY DO THE PASSWORDS LOOK WEIRD?
Because they're encrypted. There is a key inside of the files which you can use to decrypt the encrypted strings. You should also change this key, since this is open source.

# HOW DO I ADD NEW AVATARS?
Simply add the new avatars into the respective folder, with the "default" folder containing all of the guest-only icons. Then, you can follow the style.css file to learn how to customize these avatars.
