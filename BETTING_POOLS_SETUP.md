# Betting Pools Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the betting pools feature for your DRRR-like chat application.

## Prerequisites

- Admin access to the application
- Database access

## Installation Steps

### 1. Create Database Tables

Run the setup script to create the necessary database tables:

1. Log in as an admin user
2. Navigate to `setup_betting_pools.php` in your browser
3. The script will create:
   - `betting_pools` table: Stores betting pool information
   - `betting_pool_bets` table: Stores individual user bets

### 2. Verify Installation

The betting pools feature has been integrated into the room interface with the following components:

**Backend:**
- `api/betting_pool.php` - API endpoint for all betting pool operations
- `setup_betting_pools.php` - Database setup script

**Frontend:**
- `js/betting_pool.js` - JavaScript functionality
- `css/betting_pool.css` - Styling

**Modified Files:**
- `room.php` - Added betting pool button and included scripts/styles
- `api/get_room_users.php` - Added bet amount to user data
- `js/room.js` - Added bet amount badge display and initialization

## Troubleshooting

If betting pools aren't working:

1. Check that database tables were created successfully
2. Verify all files are in the correct locations
3. Clear browser cache to reload JavaScript and CSS
4. Check browser console for errors

6. Ensure user is registered to place bets
