; php.ini for SSE - Minimal safe settings for shared hosting
; Many settings cannot be changed on shared hosting - this includes only what's allowed

; Allow scripts to run for SSE connections (usually works)
max_execution_time = 30

; Disable output buffering (usually works)
output_buffering = Off

; Memory limit (if allowed)
memory_limit = 128M

; NOTE: Most other settings like PHP-FPM workers, Apache limits, and 
; database connections CANNOT be changed on shared hosting.
; The optimized code compensates by using shorter connections and
; better resource management.
